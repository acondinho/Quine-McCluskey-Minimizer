*Purpose*
As part of my EE106 class we learned about
minimzing logic functions using the 
Quine-McCluskey algorithim. This program
will be using the tabular method to accept
the min terms of a given logic function 
and output the simplified form
Adding new forks

*Status*
- Program accepts input for number of inputs and the min terms
- Does validation on input
- Translates min terms into binary values and assigns group ID
